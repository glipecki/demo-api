# Demo API

This is a Demo API ([Spring-Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) + [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) + [Spring REST Docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-restdocs/docs/current/reference/html5/)) intended to make it easy for you to understand how to use Spring REST Docs to produce high-quality documentation for your RESTful services. However, we canâ€™t achieve that goal without your contributions.
Feel free to contribute to this repo (https://github.com/thiagotn/demo-api/), sending pull requests any time :)
